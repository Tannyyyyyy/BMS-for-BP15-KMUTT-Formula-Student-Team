# Introduction
From August 2023 to January 2024, I became part of the Black Pearl Racing Team BP15. Since the Electrical & Control Team lacked experienced members, I took on the leadership role as head of the team. Our primary objective was to gather all necessary data for developing an electric vehicle, as this marked our inaugural year transitioning to electric propulsionâ€”making it fundamentally a learning and experimentation phase. For this year's vehicle design, we adopted 'LACONIC' as our guiding design philosophy.

# Problem
Despite flaws in our initial design that prevented us from implementing our systems that year, we successfully gathered comprehensive data using energy meters and power consumption equations. Following the TSAE competition in 2024, we returned to our university to develop an improved design, which led to the creation of the BP16 car.

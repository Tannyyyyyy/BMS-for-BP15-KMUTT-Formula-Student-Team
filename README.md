Designed a PCB for  battery monitoring and balancing unit in Formula Student Car by using passive balance system

From August 2023 to January 2024, I became part of the Black Pearl Racing Team BP15. Since the Electrical & Control Team lacked experienced members, I took on the leadership role as head of the team. Our primary objective was to gather all necessary data for developing an electric vehicle, as this marked our inaugural year transitioning to electric propulsionâ€”making it fundamentally a learning and experimentation phase. For this year's vehicle design, we adopted 'LACONIC' as our guiding design philosophy.
